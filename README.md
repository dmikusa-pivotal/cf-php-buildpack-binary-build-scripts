CloudFoundry PHP Build Pack Binary Build Scripts
================================================

This is a set of scripts that can be used to build the binary files required by the CF PHP Build Pack.  This works for the [CF PHP Build Pack](coming soon).

This repo contains a set of bash scripts that can be used to build HTTPD 2.4.x, PHP 5.4.x and PHP 5.5.x.  The scripts are configured with variables at the top and can be used to build different versions of each project and modules for the projects.  The scripts are designed to be run on Ubuntu 10.04, which is the current stack used by CF.  As CF updates its stacks, this project will be adjusted to build for those environments as well.
